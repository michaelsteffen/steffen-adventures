Yangshuo is not only a [superb cycling spot](), it's also the rock climbing capital of China.  There are dozens if not hundreds of bolted routes on nearby karsts. Many of the hotels have names like [] and [].  

We are far from expert rock climbers. We've gone a dozen times or so in the states, but are not yet skilled enough to lead a climb or set up a top-rope.  So, we were pretty thrilled to squeeze in a handful of climbs into our time in Yangshuo.

Our first time out, we went with a local company to a site called Swiss Cheese. Mercifully, our guide spoke a bit of English. In mandarin, the words for “right”, “left”, “hand,” and “foot” sound a lot alike -- even when you are not clinging to a rock 30 feet up. We were joined by a young Chinese guy who was rock climbing for his first time. Our exchange was in a mixture of bad English (his) and even worse Chinese (ours), so we could be completely wrong -- but it seemed he was traveling alone through China for 4 months. If so, this is a rare phenomenon. The Chinese are beginning to travel - in droves. We saw many many Chinese tourists in New Zealand, Hong Kong, and all over Yangshuo. Butit seems they usually travel (and eat!) in big families or even bigger tour groups. With his long hair, ripped jeans, and stylish yellow socks (notably worn even under his climbing shoes), Daun was going solo.

On our first outing, we ran into Chen Lu -- a French woman who has been studying Chinese in Yangshuo for many months -- and rock climbs 2-3 times a week. (Chen Lu is an adopted name.) She welcomed us to join her for future climbs - which of course we accepted. So for our next outing we biked out to "Wine Bottle" a secluded site across the main road from Swiss Cheese.

The highest climbs were the best -- as you near the top, you emerge above the bamboo tree tops to views of the karsts. all around.
