Our second weekend in Yangshuo, we took a field trip to the Longji rice terraces.  These scenic rice paddies line the sides of steep hills in the Guangxi countryside.  (Longjis is a [XXX] in Guanxi). These landscapes were made famous in the 19X0s by [], a Chinese photographer, and have now become a major tourist destination, particularly for Chinese tourists. In addition to seeing these iconic views, the trip gave us another opportunity to practice our burgeoning Mandarin skills.

To get to Longji, we took the bus from Yangshuo north to Guilin.  We spent the night in Guilin, enjoying an evening walk around to the town's brightly lit waterways, peppered with color-changing bridges and tall pagodas. The next morning we caught a minibus from Guilin to the town of [] about a 90-minute drive. 

Longji's most famous sites are clustered around [], [], and [] -- but the highlight of the weekend was the 3-hour walk between the first two villages. Setting out, we'd been unsure whether we'd want a guide for this walk, so we figured we'd play it by ear and that there would be plenty of opportunities to hire some help if it proved necessary.

Indeed, as we reached the outskirts of [], a viewpoint poetically named "", we struggled to find the path onwards to []. As we asked around for directions, one of the merchants offered to walk with us.  Her asking price for the three hour hike: $15.  We didn't have the heart to bargain.

The walk between [X] and [Y] is lovely -- perhaps less dramatic than the sites at either end, but with much greater solitude to more than offset the slightly diminsihed views. The real highlight of the hike, however, was our guide, Pang Liang Yan.

Joking and chatted with us the whole way, Pang Liang Yan gamely working with us to overcome the language barrier and help us practice our Chinese. We learned that she was [] years old, had [] kids and [] grandkids.  She asked us the price of our entrance tickets ($15) and bus ride to Longji ($20). She idintified for us all the various crops. (Pumpkins, peppers, and corn are all grown on the Longji terraces, along with rice.) And she told us that she'd spent her whole life in and around the [] countryside, judging even the short bus ride into Guilin and unaffordable extravagance. She vigorously disagreed when we suggested the bus price might be lower for locals than for us foreigners.

After saying our goodbyes to Pang Liang Yan, we enjoyed a beer on the deck of our hotel and settled in for the evening. The next morning, we finsihed the walk into [] and then couldn't resist the noisy cable car up to one final viewpoint before boarding the minibus back to Guilin.

After spending Sunday night again in Guilin, we used Monday morning for a short coda to our Longji fieldtrip - a four hour river cruise back to Yangshuo along the Li River.
