We arrived in Queenstown on May 5th.  And our long-awaited adventure begins!

Queenstown is gorgeous. The panorama of the city below was literally taken on the drive from the airport to our hotel, thanks to Blair, our gregarious shuttle driver. We splurged on an incredible hotel room for our first night in Queenstown. We bought a bottle of wine, and soaked in the views and the sunset.

We awoke the next morning to a downpour--the first of several days of rainy weather. We caught the bus to Te Anau to begin the trekking phase of our adventure. With several more days of wet weather ahead, we decided to start with the Kepler track, the driest of the Fjordland triumvirate that we plan to walk (Kepler-Milford-Routeburn).

We took a day to organize ourselves and buy supplies. The next morning, we hiked up to Luxmore hut, the first stop on the Kepler, taking advantage of a short reprieve in the rain.  New Zealand's Department of Conservation maintains an incredible hut system along the country's major hiking and treking routes.  Even off season, these huts offer a common room to cook your meals, basic bunks, gorgeous picture windows, and a woodburning stove that warms the well-insulated common rooms.

We spent two nights at the Luxmore hut before the weather broke again and we headed across the ridge. It was overcast, but with dramatic, mysterious views periodically emerging through the clouds.

After another quiet rainy day at the next hut, we combined the final two days of the Kepler track for a big 25 mile walk back to Te Anau, a flat through ferns, moss covered forests, and along Lake Manpouri and the Waiau rier. We arrived back to Te Anau just as the sun was setting over the lake.

Now we rest up for a day and get ready for the next stage of our journey.
