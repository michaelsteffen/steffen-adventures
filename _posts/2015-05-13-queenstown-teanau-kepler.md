We arrived in Queenstown on May 5th.  And our long-awaited adventure begins!

Queenstown is gorgeous! The panorama of the city below was literally taken on the drive from the airport to our hotel, thanks to Blair, our gregarious shuttle driver. We splurged on an incredible hotel room for our first night in Queenstown. We bought a bottle of wine, and soaked in the views and the sunset.

We awoke the next morning to a downpour - the first of several days of rainy weather. We caught the bus to Te Anau, to try to begin the trekking phase of our adventure. With several more days of wet weather ahead, we decided to start with the Kepler track, the driest of the Fjordland triumvirate that we plan to walk (Kepler-Milford-Routeburn).

The next day, we walked to Luxmore hut, the first stop on the Kepler, in a bit of a reprieve. We spent two nights at Luxmore before the weather broke again and we headed across the ridge. It was cloudy, but with beuatiful dramatic, mysterious views periodically peeking through the mist.

After another quiet rainy day at the next hut, we joined the final two days of the Kepler track for a big 25 mile walk back to Te Anau

Now we rest up for a day and get ready for the next steps.
