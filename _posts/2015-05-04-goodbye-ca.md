It's been quite a couple weeks.  For the second time in a year, we had our tickets booked and our plans all set for Nepal, and a car-ride arranged for Indy to her temporary home with Michael's parents in Houston.  

Then, on the Wednesday before our last weekend in town, driving plans changed and I had to scramble to book a last minute plane flight to shuttle Indy to Texas. On Saturday, we woke up early to head to the airport, only to see the first tragic headlines of the Nepal earthquake.

Less than a week later, we've managed to piece our plans back together, and are headed to New Zealand, for adventures in a different set of world-class mountains.  Indy's off to Houston, we're packed up, and off we go.

We only wish the many, many lives devastated by the tragedy in Nepal could be so easily repaired.  Our thoughts will be with the country as we head out.
